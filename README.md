### Package managers

Chosen is available through [Bower](https://bower.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com),
_however, the package names are not the same_.

To install with Bower:

```
bower install chosen
```

To install with npm:

```
npm install chosen-js
```

The compiled files for these packages are automatically generated and stored in a [2nd Chosen repository](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen-package). No pull requests will be accepted to that repository.
