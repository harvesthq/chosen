# Chosen

Chosen is a library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more user friendly.

- jQuery support: 1.4+
- Prototype support: 1.7+

For **documentation**, usage, and examples, see:
http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/

For **downloads**, see:
https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/releases/

### Bower Installation

Chosen does _**not**_ currently support command-line `bower install chosen` installation. This is because the repo does not contain the compiled sources, and bower does not currently support adding a post-install/build step.

However, you can specify that you'd like to use [the release ZIP](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/releases/latest), which includes the compiled and minified sources.

Either install from the command line with

```
$ bower install https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/releases/download/v1.4.1/chosen_v1.4.1.zip
````

or add Chosen to your own project's `bower.json` file, like:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "1.11.0",
    "chosen": "https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/releases/download/v1.4.1/chosen_v1.4.1.zip"
  }
}
```
