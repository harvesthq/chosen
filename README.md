# Chosen

There's a lot of great stuff going on in Chosen, and a lot of bad. The time has come for the folks at FINE to choose what they like about Chosen, and to burn the rest.

Let's use this README.md to track progress on specific features. Discussion will happen in a Slack channel dedicated to the project.
