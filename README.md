### Contributing to Chosen

Contributions and pull requests are very welcome. Please follow these guidelines when submitting new code.

1. Make all changes in Coffeescript files, **not** JavaScript files.
2. For feature changes, update both jQuery *and* Prototype versions
3. Use `npm install` to install the correct development dependencies.
4. Use `grunt build` or `grunt watch` to generate Chosen's JavaScript file and minified version.
5. Submit a Pull Request using GitHub.

### Using CoffeeScript & Cake

First, make sure you have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) in place. We have added a package.json that makes this easy:

```
npm install
```

This will install all development dependencies as `node_modules`.

Once you're configured, building the JavasScript from the command line is easy:

    grunt build                # build Chosen from source
    grunt watch                # watch coffee/ for changes and build Chosen
